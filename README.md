# LiriBot

This is my Liri Bot

It functions using node.js in your terminal/bash window

To use Liri, simply code in "node liri.js spotify-this" plus a song of choice and see the results,
or you can also type "node liri.js movie-this" plus title of a movie, or " node liri.js concert-this" or "node liri.js do-what-it-says"
